## How to manage branches

1. Switch local branch

Usage scenario: switching when there are branches A and B locally. For example, the current working branch is A and needs to be switched to B

```shell
git checkout B
```

2. Switch remote branch

Usage scenario: There is only branch A locally, and there are A and B remotely. You need to switch the local branch from A to branch B

- First check all branches (including remote ones)

```shell
git branch -a
```

- Switch branch

```shell
git checkout -b B origin/B 
// Checkout the remote B branch, name it locally as B branch, and switch to the local B branch
```

3. Local branch associated with remote branch

```shell
git branch --set-upstream {local branch} origin/{remote branch}
```

4. View local and remote branch relationships

```shell
git config --list
```
